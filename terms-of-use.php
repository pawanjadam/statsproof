                                            Recipient acknowledges that monetary damages would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by Recipient and that any such breach would cause Disclosing Party irreparable harm. Accordingly, Recipient also agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, Disclosing Party, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity it may have (none of which remedies shall be mutually exclusive, and all of which remedies may be pursued concurrently and cumulatively), shall be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance. In addition, in such an event, the Party in violation shall reimburse the other Party for all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred in order to enforce the provisions of this Agreement and/or exercise any remedies for a violation thereof.
